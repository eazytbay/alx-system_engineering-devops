Postmortem: Website Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (GMT+1 timezone) on [25th Jan 2022].
Impact: The website experienced a complete outage, rendering it inaccessible to all users. Approximately 95% of users were affected.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on the server infrastructure.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: Monitoring alerts indicated a spike in server errors, signaling the onset of the issue.
10:15 AM: An engineer detected the issue independently and initiated an investigation.
10:30 AM: Initial investigation focused on server logs and network traffic to identify potential causes.
10:45 AM: Misleadingly, the team initially suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden increase in traffic.
11:00 AM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further investigation and resolution.
11:30 AM: Upon thorough analysis, the misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified as the root cause.
11:45 AM: The load balancer settings were corrected, and the website services were restored to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in uneven distribution of traffic among the servers, causing some servers to become overloaded while others remained underutilized.
Resolution: The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all servers, ensuring optimal performance and stability.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring and alerting for load balancer configurations to detect potential issues proactively.
Conduct regular audits of infrastructure configurations to identify and address any discrepancies or misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch the load balancer software to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Develop and implement a comprehensive incident response plan to streamline communication and resolution during outages.
Enhance team training and awareness on load balancer management and troubleshooting techniques.
By addressing the root cause and implementing preventive measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar incidents in the future and ensure a seamless user experience for our website visitors.
